Product Name (Working Title):

Pulse — Mood & Habit Insights, Simplified

1. Problem Statement

Many people want to improve their mental well-being and daily habits but feel overwhelmed by complex tracking apps that require too much effort, data entry, or interpretation. Existing mood and habit trackers often fail because they demand high consistency, offer generic advice, or present insights that feel disconnected from daily life.

There is an opportunity to build a lightweight, low-friction app that helps users quickly log their mood and habits, then surface simple patterns and actionable suggestions that feel achievable and personal.

2. Product Vision

Create a calm, intuitive app that helps users understand how their habits influence their mood — without guilt, pressure, or cognitive overload.

The app should feel like:

A gentle daily check-in

A mirror, not a judge

A nudge toward small improvements, not life overhauls

3. Goals & Success Metrics
Primary Goals

Encourage consistent daily check-ins

Help users recognize patterns between mood and habits

Drive small, sustainable behavior changes

Success Metrics (Prototype / Early Stage)

Day 7 retention ≥ 30%

Daily check-in completion rate ≥ 60%

Users viewing insights at least 3x per week

At least 1 suggested action engaged with per week per active user

10. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Users forget to log	Gentle, configurable reminders
App feels judgmental	Carefully written copy and tone
Low engagement with insights	Keep insights short and visual
Over-complexity	Strict scope control
11. Open Questions (For Future Iteration)

Should habits be fully customizable?

How much explanation do users want behind insights?

What tone resonates best: clinical vs conversational?

When should suggestions be shown (morning vs evening)?

12. Summary

This prototype focuses on clarity, consistency, and calmness. The goal is not to fix users’ lives, but to help them notice patterns and make small, meaningful changes over time. By keeping interactions short and insights human-readable, the app aims to become a daily companion rather than another abandoned tracker.
