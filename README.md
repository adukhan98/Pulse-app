# Pulse — Mood & Habit Insights

Pulse is a calm, intuitive web application designed to help users understand how their daily habits influence their mood. Built with a "Calm Tech" philosophy, it serves as a gentle daily mirror rather than a demanding tracker.

## 🌿 Product Vision

Many self-improvement apps feel overwhelming, requiring heavy data entry and offering generic advice. Pulse aims to be different:
- **Low Friction:** Log your day in under 10 seconds.
- **Non-Judgmental:** A tool for reflection, not a scorecard.
- **Insightful:** Connects the dots between sleep, screen time, and how you feel.

## ✨ Features

- **Daily Check-ins:** Quick, tap-based logging for mood (1-5 scale) and key habits.
- **Habit Tracking:** Simple sliders and toggles for Sleep, Exercise, and Screen Time.
- **Gentle Insights:** Visualizations and detected patterns (e.g., "You feel better when you sleep 7+ hours").
- **Actionable Suggestions:** Small, achievable prompts to improve well-being.
- **Calm Aesthetic:** Designed with a soothing Sage Green & Warm Beige palette to reduce anxiety.
